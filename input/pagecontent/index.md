### Introduction
This implementation guide is provided to support the use of HL7<sup>&reg;</sup> FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> in an Australian context for TBD.

Insert purpose and scope of MyDraftIG here.

#### Relationship between HL7 AU and this implementation guide
* This implementation guide is published as a proof of concept implementation guide known to HL7 Australia.
* The content in this proof of concept guide may become an HL7 Australia specification.   
* This implementation guide is not endorsed by HL7 Australia or any of its members just by being made available via HL7 Australia or because it uses content from HL7 Australia specifications.

### How to Read this Guide

This guide is divided into several pages which are listed at the top of each page in the menu bar.

- [Home](index.html): This page provides the introduction and scope for this guide.
- [Guidance](guidance.html): This page provides guidance on using the profiles defined in this guide.
- [FHIR Artefacts](artifacts.html): These pages provide detailed descriptions and formal definitions for all the FHIR artefacts defined in this guide.
  - [Profiles and Extensions](profiles-and-extensions.html): This set of pages describes the profiles and extensions that are defined in this guide to represent Australian local concepts using FHIR. Each profile page includes a narrative description, guidance, and formal definition. Although the guidance typically focuses on the profiled elements and seeks to provide a ‘how-to’ guide when representing concepts, it may also may focus on un-profiled elements to aid with implementation.
  - [Terminology](terminology.html): This set of pages lists the value sets and code systems defined in this guide.
- [Examples](examples.html): This page lists all the examples used in this guide.
- [Downloads](downloads.html): This page provides links to downloadable artefacts including the AU Base FHIR NPM package.


### Collaboration
This guide is the product of collaborative work undertaken with participants from:

* [Magentus Practice Management](https://www.magentus.com/practice-management)
* [Sonic Healthcare](http://https://www.sonichealthcare.com/)

FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> connectathon events are key to the verification of the guide as being suitable for 
implementation. This implementation guide will be used as the basis for Australian connectathon events.
