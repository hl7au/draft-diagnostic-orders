### Issues and Opportunities

- The use of the information in coverage needs to be clarified. For some, it will be seen as a suggestion for payment as indicated by the placer, while for others it will be seen as part of the agreed request and thus, expected to be followed.
- In some cases, there could be a pre-agreed funding commitment.  For example, a request has been agreed to be funded by bulk-billed by MBS and carries an approval code.
