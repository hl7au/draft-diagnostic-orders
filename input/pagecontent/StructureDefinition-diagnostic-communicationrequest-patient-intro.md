The CommunicationRequest supports Patient communication from the filler to the Patient.  It either requests communication or disallows it. In many ways it acts as a Consent which is more unique to the request family. Existing HL7v2-based requesting allows for patient communication for pre-collection guidance or collection centre location information but permission to do so is constrained through a variety of mechanisms; access to mobile phone number, comments in clinical notes, etc.  In some cases, patients donâ€™t want to be contacted or practises don't want their patients to be contacted.  This can also impact on the mechanism and role of patient choice in selecting a service provider.
